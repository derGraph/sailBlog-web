# sailBlog

### This is a project to share and record voyage data when sailing. It is my first attempt in svelte.

It uses prisma for Database Management. The project should adhere to EU-GDPR rules.
The companion app is written in flutter and is used to inject the data into the database.
All API-Endpoints used in the project are also available to the public. Log in via POST to /login and then use the cookie!

The project is auto built into a docker container published to Github Packages!

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
